    <h2>Components of Data Communication:</h2>
    <p>Data communication involves the transmission of data between devices. The key components include the sender, receiver, message, medium, and protocol.</p>

    <h2>Distributed Processing:</h2>
    <p>Distributed processing involves the use of multiple computers working in parallel to solve a problem by dividing tasks among them.</p>

    <h2>Line Configuration, Topology:</h2>
    <p><strong>Line Configuration:</strong> Refers to the arrangement of communication channels, such as point-to-point or multipoint.</p>
    <p><strong>Topology:</strong> Describes the physical or logical layout of a network, including bus, star, ring, etc.</p>

    <h2>Transmission Mode:</h2>
    <p>Transmission mode determines the direction of data flow between devices. It can be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex.</p>

    <h2>Categories of Networks:</h2>
    <p>Networks can be categorized based on their size and purpose, such as LANs (Local Area Networks), WANs (Wide Area Networks), and MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks).</p>

    <h2>OSI and TCP/IP Models:</h2>
    <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP models are frameworks defining network protocols and communication layers.</p>

    <h2>Transmission Media: Guided and Unguided:</h2>
    <p><strong>Guided:</strong> Includes cables and wires, such as twisted pair and fiber optics.</p>
    <p><strong>Unguided:</strong> Involves wireless communication mediums, such as radio waves and microwaves.</p>

    <h2>Attenuation, Distortion, Noise, Throughput:</h2>
    <p><strong>Attenuation:</strong> Weakening of signals over distance.</p>
    <p><strong>Distortion:</strong> Alteration of the signal shape.</p>
    <p><strong>Noise:</strong> Unwanted signals that interfere with communication.</p>
    <p><strong>Throughput:</strong> Actual data transfer rate.</p>

    <h2>Propagation Speed and Time, Wavelength, Shannon Capacity:</h2>
    <p><strong>Propagation Speed:</strong> Speed at which signals travel.</p>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> Duration for a signal to travel from sender to receiver.</p>
    <p><strong>Wavelength:</strong> Distance between successive peaks of a wave.</p>
    <p><strong>Shannon Capacity:</strong> Maximum data rate for reliable communication.</p>
